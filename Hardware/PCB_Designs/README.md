## 🖥️ PCB Designs

This folder contains PCB layouts and designs used in the **EEE Rover Project**. 

## 📂 Files Included
- `pcb_layouts.pdf`: A consolidated PDF containing the final PCB layouts for signal processing and motor control circuits.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **LTSpice**: For circuit simulations before PCB design.
- **Manual PCB Design**: Circuits were soldered onto stripboards, and corresponding PCBs were designed manually.

## 🖇️ How to Use
1. Open `pcb_layouts.pdf` for an overview of the PCB designs.
2. Refer to LTSpice files in `../Circuit_Diagrams/` for circuit simulations.
