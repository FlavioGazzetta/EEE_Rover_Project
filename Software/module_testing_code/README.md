## üì° **Radio Signal Software**

### **Overview**
The software processes analog signals to determine their frequency. Using an Arduino, the system counts the number of rising edges over a defined period to calculate the frequency of the signal. The calculated frequencies are displayed on the serial monitor every 100 milliseconds to avoid excessive output clutter.

### **Algorithm Design**
The logic used for the radio signal frequency detection is illustrated in the following flowchart:

### **Explanation**
1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The Arduino reads the analog signal and checks if the value crosses the defined threshold.
   - The frequency is determined by counting rising edges within an interval.
   - Every 1-second interval, the average frequency is calculated and displayed.

2. **Output**:
   - The frequency is output to the serial monitor every 100ms, allowing real-time monitoring.

### **Test Results**
The system successfully detected the frequencies of the radio signal during tests, as shown in the serial monitor output:

## üõ∞Ô∏è **Ultrasound Signal Software**

### **Overview**
This module decodes lizard names from digital signals received in UART format. The program efficiently handles bit-reversal, start/stop bits, and ensures stable output.

### **Test Results**
During testing, the module successfully decoded various lizard names from ultrasound signals. An example output is shown below:

## üåà **Infrared Signal Software**

### **Overview**
This module processes infrared signals to calculate frequency and determine the lizard species. Instead of the previously implemented FFT algorithm, a simpler peak-counting method was used to minimize complexity and improve performance.

### **Algorithm Design**
The logic for infrared signal frequency detection is illustrated below:

### **Explanation**
1. **Peak Detection**:
   - The software counts peaks to determine the time between them (period).
   - The frequency is calculated as the inverse of the period.

2. **Why Not FFT?**:
   - FFT was avoided due to storage issues and the need for an overly precise strategy.
   - The simpler algorithm is more resource-efficient and achieves the required accuracy.

### **Test Results**
The system correctly detected the frequencies for two predefined lizard species during tests:
- Abronia: **571 Hz**
- Dixonius: **353 Hz**

The test output is shown below:

## üß≤ **Magnetic Signal Software**

### **Overview**
The magnetic signal module detects the magnetic polarity (North Pole, South Pole, or Neutral) to identify the lizard's orientation.

### **Test Results**
The system accurately detected magnetic polarities during testing:

## üî¨ **Conclusion**

The software testing for all four modules‚ÄîRadio, Ultrasound, Infrared, and Magnetic‚Äîwas successful. Each module demonstrated accurate signal processing and reliable performance, meeting the design requirements. These results confirm the robustness of the hardware-software integration in the rover's signal detection and processing system.
